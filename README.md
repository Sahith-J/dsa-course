- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks and Queues (including Circular Queues)
- Hashing and HashMaps
- String Manipulation

---

## Weeks 3-4: Advanced Data Structures

**Focus**: Explore more complex data structures for efficient data handling.

### Topics:
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Trie (Prefix Trees)

---

## Weeks 5-6: Algorithms

**Focus**: Master key algorithms used for sorting, searching, and optimization.

### Topics:
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)

---

## Weeks 7-8: Advanced Algorithms and Problem Solving

**Focus**: Tackle complex algorithms and enhance problem-solving skills through real-world scenarios.

### Topics:
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal’s, Prim’s)
- Backtracking (N-Queens, Subset Sum, Permutations)
- Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search Tree operations)
- Competitive Programming Practice
